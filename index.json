In healthcare, synthetic data generation can be helpful for producing annotated data and improving data-driven research without worries on data privacy. However, electronic health records (EHRs) are noisy, incomplete and complex, and existing work on EHR data is mainly devoted to generating discrete elements such as diagnosis codes and medications or frequent laboratory values. In this work, we propose SMOOTH-GAN, a novel approach for generating reliable EHR data such as laboratory values and medications given diagnosis codes. SMOOTH-GAN takes advantage of a conditional GAN architecture with WGAN-GP loss, and is able to learn transitions between disease stages with high flexibility over data customization. Our experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness in terms of both statistical similarity and accuracy on machine learning based prediction. To further demonstrate the usage of our model, we apply counterfactual reasoning and generate data with occurrence of multiple diseases, which can provide unique datasets for artificial intelligence driven healthcare research.","tags":[],"title":"SMOOTH-GAN: Towards Sharp and Smooth Synthetic EHR Data Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In GANs, a discriminator is trained to discriminate whether a given sample is drawn from data distribution or model distribution. A generator (i.e., model) is trained to ‚Äúfool‚Äù the discriminator by generating samples that are close to the real data. In reward learning true reward function may not be optimal or even known, GASIL learns a discriminator which acts as an internal reward function that the policy should maximize. In self imitation learning the agent directly from the past experience by retrieving similar states in the past and choosing the best action made in the past. In GASIL architecture, the agent directly learns to imitate past good trajectories without learning a generative model. GASIL can be viewed as a generative adversarial extension of self-imitation learning. The GASIL approach stores and imitates the high reward trajectories seen in the past, and imitates them in the Adversarial framework. GASIL could be complemented with the Q-Learning or Policy gradient in the control part of the reinforcement learning. We implemented the GASIL in multi-agent environment and our results show that the GASIL outperforms the basline DDPG model.s\n","date":1589760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589760000,"objectID":"70205418690a46d47bd752ec9065349f","permalink":"https://anuragdutt.github.io/project/gasil/","publishdate":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gasil/","section":"project","summary":"This project implements and experiments a Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL)approach for the multiagent predator prey environment.","tags":["Deep Learning","Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Imitation Learning","Self Imitation Learning"],"title":"Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (Graduate project)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this work we test if financial reports can be utilized to research the significance of text analysis for stock price prediction.

We use data on customers of a financial services provider from three states in India and find that the probability of repurchase is highest in the first 2 months after the contract expires, and steadily declines after. This suggests a window of opportunity for financial firms and governments to target customers to ensure continuous insurance purchase. Nonmembership of microfinance groups and poor rainfall in the month of expiry affect the time to repurchase adversely. Customers who take longer to repurchase tend to increase the amount of insurance cover.","tags":[],"title":"From Participation To Repurchase: Low Income Households And Micro‚Äêinsurance","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
